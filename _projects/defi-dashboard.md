## The Challenge

DeFi users struggle to track their investments across multiple protocols, leading to poor financial decisions and security risks.

## My Role

Lead UX Designer working with 2 developers and 1 product manager over 3 months.

## Process

### Research & Discovery

- Conducted 15 user interviews with DeFi users
- Analyzed existing portfolio tracking tools
- Identified key pain points in multi-protocol management

### Key Insights

1. **Cognitive Overload**: Users felt overwhelmed by complex data
2. **Trust Issues**: Security concerns about connecting wallets
3. **Fragmented Experience**: No single source of truth for portfolio data

### Design Solution

#### Information Architecture
- Prioritized high-level portfolio overview
- Grouped similar protocols together
- Progressive disclosure for detailed data

#### Security-First Approach
- Clear explanation of read-only wallet connection
- Visual indicators for security status
- Option for manual address input

#### Visual Design
- Clean, dashboard-style layout
- Color-coded profit/loss indicators
- Mobile-first responsive design

## Results

- 40% reduction in task completion time
- 85% user satisfaction score
- 30% increase in daily active users

## Technical Implementation

Built with React, Web3.js, and integrated with:
- Ethereum mainnet
- Polygon network
- Major DeFi protocols (Uniswap, Aave, Compound)
